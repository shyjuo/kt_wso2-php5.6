<H2><B>WSO2 WSF/Spring 1.5</B></H2>
<P>Welcome to the WSO2 Web Services Framework for Spring release 1.5.</P>
<P>WSO2 WSF/Spring provides an amazingly simple Code First approach to create Web Services for the Spring user. 
This framework integrates the Apache Axis2 web services engine into Spring. Thus, providing all the power and 
versatility of the Axis2 engine to the Spring user.</p>
<p>Now, with just a few entries in the application context, Spring users can enjoy the benefits of Service 
Oriented Architecture using Web Services in their applications.</P>
<H2><B>Features</B></H2>
<UL>
	<LI><P>Support for exposing Spring services through the IOC container</P>
	<LI><P>Support for editing Axis 2 booting configuration through the IOC container</P>
	<LI><P>Automated WSDL generation of Spring services</P>
	<LI><P>Support for querying service's WSDL (with ?wsdl), schema (with ?xsd) and	policies (with ?policy)</P>
	<LI><P>Deployment of Axis2 Modules (WS-Addressing, WS-Security, etc.) through the classpath</P>
	<LI><P>Support for WS Policy expressions as a configuration mechanism for services</P>
	<LI><P>Method exclusion in Spring beans supported</P>
</UL>
<H2><B>Known Issues</B></H2>
<OL>
	<LI><p>Due to limitations in Axis2, method overloading is not supported, and hence the WSDL for services 
	where methods are overloaded cannot be generated. Hence, all WSDL based functionality related to services
	will not work for such services.</P>
	<LI><p>You cannot have two different versions of the Apache Sandesha2 module in the system.</P>
</OL>
