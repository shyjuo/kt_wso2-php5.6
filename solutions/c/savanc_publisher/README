this is the solution using Savan/C that use WSO2 Registry to populate Savan/C database tables namely subscriber and topic.
The purpose of the solution is to provide a Savan/C service that acts as a wrapper event source for WSO2 ESB. The
interested subscribers are retrieved from WSO2 Registry at service start up.

This has two Axis2/C services called wso2 and wsfc. wso2 acts as publisher service. wsfc acts as the listner service.
You need following resource structure in your registry for this demo to run
/topics/wso2/wsfc/system.subscriptions/

Within this subscriptions folder you should have subs1.xml and subs2.xml which can be copied there from subscribers folder in this source structure.

Then you need to install Axis2/C, Savan/C and this demo application. See for the installation instructions in the INSTALL file.

Then once you start the Axis2/C server the wso2 publisher service starts to publish to the wsfc listner service.
Following is a sample publisher service configuration xml file where you need to specify registry specific information

<service name="wso2">
    <parameter name="ServiceClass" locked="xsd:false">wso2</parameter>
    <parameter name="loadServiceAtStartup" locked="xsd:false">true</parameter>
    <parameter name="registry_url" locked="xsd:false">http://localhost:8082/wso2registry/atom</parameter>
    <parameter name="registry_username" locked="xsd:false">damitha</parameter>
    <parameter name="registry_password" locked="xsd:false">damitha</parameter>

       This is a sample eventing data source which loads as the axis2 engine startup and
       start publishing to its subscribers.
   </description>
   <module ref="savan"/>
   <parameter name="TopicURL" locked="xsd:false">http://localhost:9090/axis2/services/wso2</parameter>

   <operation name="start">
           <parameter name="wsamapping" >http://ws.apache.org/axis2/c/savan/samples/wso2/start</parameter>
   </operation>
</service>
