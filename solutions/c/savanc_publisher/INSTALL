This implementation consists of a demo Axis2/C service implemetation which acts as a Savan/C publisher service.
When deployed it will connect to the WSO2 registry and retrieve the subscribers registered for this service. Then it
will populate the Savan/C database with those subscribers. After that when service started it will publish sample
data to those subscribers. 
In this demo implemtation the subscribers registered in the registry has the endpoint listener service as wsfc which is
another sample service implemented here.

To install this you need to follow the following steps.
1. Install Axis2/C
   - Define and export AXIS2C_HOME environment variable to indicate your repository location. I assume it to be <axis2c_home> for 
     the instructions purposes in this document.
   - Download Axis2/C source
   - cofigure --prefix=<axis2c_home> --enable-tests=no
     make
     make install

    For more information on installing Axis2/C see http://ws.apache.org/axis2/c/docs/installationguide.html
2. Install Savan/C

    ./configure --prefix=<axis2c_home> --enable-static=no --with-axis2=${AXIS2C_HOME}/include/axis2-1.5.0 --enable-filtering=no
    make
    make install

    For more information on installing Savan/C see http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/webservices/savan/trunk/c/INSTALL
3. Install this demo
    This demo needs libcurl and libraptor libraries in the LD_LIBRARRY_PATH. 
    libcurl is used to make requests to the
    registry. It can be downloaded from http://curl.haxx.se/download.html
    libraptor is an atom parser which can be downloaded from http://librdf.org/raptor/

    configure --prefix=<axis2c_home> --with-axis2=${AXIS2C_HOME}/include/axis2-1.5.0 --with-savan=${AXIS2C_HOME}/include/savan-0.90
    make
    make install

   This will install wso2 sample publisher service and wsfc sample listener service at <axis2c_home>/services repository
   service folder.
