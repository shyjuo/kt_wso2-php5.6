Running the Samples
-------------------
- The samples for WSFC_Unit will be found in,
  {WSFC_HOME}/bin/test/framework/samples/. You can execute it
  from that location.


Sample
------
- The sample named sample, will have two test sets, having five
  test cases altogether. In the first test set, one test case 
  should fail.

- Listing all available test cases can be done by, running
  ./sample -l on Linux, or sample.exe -h on MS Windows. As you
  can see, the {executable} as in the README for the framework
  has been substituted by, 'sample'.

- For help on other options, you can run, ./sample -h on Linux,
  or sample.exe -h on MS Windows.

- You can optionally log the test result to a file, by using the 
  -f flag followed by the log_file name. A quiet mode operation
  can be achieved by using the -q flag.

- To omit a specific test you can use the -x flag. All ommited
  test names should appear as parameters. Therefore, to see a 
  successful invocation of the sample that we provide, run,
  ./sample -x test_sample1 on Linux or sample.exe -x test_sample1
  on MS Windows.
