1. How to build WSO2 WSF/Ruby under Windows from source

1.1 Requirements

   You need to download following dependency libraries:

   libxml2 binary distribution    - (Libxml2 2.6.30)
   libxslt binary distribution    - (Libxslt 1.1.23)
   iconv binary distribution      - (Iconv   1.9.2)
   OpenSSL binary distribution    - (openssl 0.98d, MSI distribution)
   Ruby Binary                    - (Ruby    1.8.6, One click installer is prefereble)
   Mysql Server [When using Reliable Messaging With MySql Database ]
                                  - (MySql    5.0 or above)

   In addition you need to have visual studio installed on your system.

   obtain libxml2, libxslt and iconv win32 binaries from [1].
   obtain OpenSSL binary from [2] [the build system assumes that you install openssl from msi].
   obtain MySql Server from [3].
   obtain Ruby Bianry from [4].

1.2 How to build WSO2 WSF/Ruby under Windows from svn source

    1. Comment the following 3 lines at the top of config.h file. 
     
       #if _MSC_VER != 1200
       #error MSC version unmatch
       #endif

       NOTE : run "ruby find_config_h.rb" in a console to find where this file is.

    2. Set 'WSFC_HOME' environment variable to where you have installed it
    
    3. Do necessary changes to "configure.in" and "configure.in.dist" files found under WSF/Ruby source directory.
	Make sure the setting CRUNTIME to MD and EMBED_MANIFEST option to 1.

    4. If you have the Visual Studio command prompt installed on your computer, 
       open it.

    5. If you don't have the Visual Studio command prompt installed on your computer, 
       open a command prompt and run vcvars32.bat.

    7. Go to the WSO2 WSF/Ruby source directory

    8. Run build_dist.bat file in the WSO2 WSF/Ruby svn checkout source directory.
 
    9. This should build the wsf ruby binary distribution to the same directory.
