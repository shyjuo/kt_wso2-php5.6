Please follow the steps below to execute the "Flickr Sample"

1. Execute following to generate a rails application.

 rails ruby.client
 cd ruby.client
 ruby script/generate controller flickr index search

2. Replace following files in your rails application directory.

 controllers/flickr_client.rb
 controllers/flickr_controller.rb
 views/flickr/index.rhtml
 views/flickr/search.rhtml

 After this step, you will have following directory structure in your 
 rails application. (only app sub directory is shown here)

 -- app
     |
     +-- controllers
     |       |
     |       +-- flickr_controller.rb (replaced with the sample flickr_controler.rb)
     |       |
     |       +-- flickr_client.rb
     |
     +-- views
           |
           +-- flickr
                 |
                 +-- index.rhtml (replaced with the sample index.rhtml)
                 |
                 +-- search.rhtml (replaced with the sample search.rhtml)

NOTE: If you are using rails 2.0.0 you may have to follow the following additional steps.

* You may need to configure the database information in your rails
application. You can find a guide on how to configure the database from the following link.
http://wiki.rubyonrails.com/rails/pages/TutorialStepOne.

* Rename both index.rhtml and search.rhtml to index.html.erb and search.html.erb.


3. Set "key" variable in flickr_controller.rb in your rails applications controller directory.
 You can generate a key from  http://www.flickr.com/services/api/

4. Start the WEBrick or Mongreal server by executing the followng commond from the root
 directory of your rails application .
 ruby script/server

5. Then Test the application from the browser.
 If the application runs on your local machine, go to http://localhost:3000/flickr/index
 to visit the application
