README for Service deployment with Rails
======================================

First you need to build a rails application to deploy the samples mentioned here.
To build an application follow the following steps. You can find a complete guide on building
a rails application from  http://wiki.rubyonrails.org/rails/pages/Tutorial.

1. Go to a directory where you want to start the rails application.

2. Run the following command.
        rails your_rails_application. 
   Here on, the term 'your_rails_application' should be renamed to the name of your application.

3. cd your_rails_application.

4. There you will find the following directory structure. (only app sub directory is shown here)

 -- app
     |
     +-- controllers
     |
     +-- views

5. Then copy the files of the relevant sample to the app/controllers directory of your rails application.
For an example, for Echo Sample you will copy echo_service_controller.rb to the app/controllers so the
directory structure after copying the Echo sample

 -- app
     |
     +-- controllers
     |       |
     |       +-- echo_service_controller.rb
     |
     +-- views

You can get the above steps done for all the provider samples by running following command from this directory.
        ruby deploy_samples.rb your_rails_application
Then you will have a rails application created in a directory called 'your_rails_application' relative to the
currrent directory.

6. Then run the ruby script/server from the root directory of your rails application to run the server. Then
the services will be deployed automatically.

7. Now you can try the services with your client using endpoint addresses mentioned in the following section.


NOTE: If you are using rails 2.0.0 or above you may need to configure the database information in your rails
application. You can find a guide on how to configure the database from the following link. 
http://wiki.rubyonrails.com/rails/pages/TutorialStepOne


Echo
----
1. Copy echo_service_controller.rb into the controllers directory of your rail application
2. Try the services with your client using following endpoint addresses:
   http://your_rails_application_uri/echo_service/echo

NOTE: your rails_application_uri is the uri where you have host your application. If you have hosted the samples in
your local machine with the port name 3000 (Which is the default for rails in-built servers), just put
localhost:3000 in the place of your_rails_application_uri

Echo with Addressing
--------------------
1. Copy echo_service_addr_controller.rb into the controllers directory of your rail application
2. Try the services with your client using following endpoint addresses:
   http://your_rails_application_uri/echo_service_addr/echo

Echo with Class Map
-------------------
1. Copy echo_classmap_service_controller.rb into the controllers directory of your rail application
2. Try the services with your client using following endpoint addresses:
   http://your_rails_application_uri/echo_classmap_service/echo

MTOM/Base64 Attachments
-----------------------
mtom/mtom_base64_upload_service_controller.rb

1. Copy mtom/mtom_base64_upload_service_controller.rb into the controllers directory of your rail application
2. Try the services with your client using following endpoint addresses:
   http://your_rails_application_uri/mtom_base64_upload_service/upload

mtom/mtom_upload_service_controller.rb

1. Copy mtom/mtom_upload_service_controller.rb into the controllers directory of your rail application
2. Try the services with your client using following endpoint addresses:
   http://your_rails_application_uri/mtom_upload_service/upload

mtom/mtom_download_service_controller.rb

1. Copy mtom/mtom_download_service_controller.rb into the controllers directory of your rail application
2. Copy mtom/resources into root directory of your rail application
3. Try the services with your client using following endpoint addresses:
   http://your_rails_application_uri/mtom_download_service/download

Reliable Messaging
------------------
reliable/echo_service_rm_controller.rb

1. Copy reliable/echo_service_rm_controller.rb into the controllers directory of your rail application
2. Try the services with your client using following endpoint addresses:
   http://your_rails_application_uri/echo_service_rm/echo

reliable/mtom_upload_service_rm_controller.rb

1. Copy reliable/mtom_upload_service_rm_controller.rb into the controllers directory of your rail application
2. Try the services with your client using following endpoint addresses:
   http://your_rails_application_uri/mtom_upload_service_rm/upload

Security
--------
security/security_controller.rb

1. Copy security/security_controller.rb into the controllers directory of your rail application
2. Copy keys and policies directories into the controllers directory of your rail application
2. Try the services with your client using following endpoint addresses:
   http://your_rails_application_uri/security/callback
   http://your_rails_application_uri/security/timestamp
   http://your_rails_application_uri/security/timestamp_file
   http://your_rails_application_uri/security/usernametoken
   http://your_rails_application_uri/security/usernametoken_file
   http://your_rails_application_uri/security/signing
   http://your_rails_application_uri/security/signing_file
   http://your_rails_application_uri/security/encryption
   http://your_rails_application_uri/security/encryption_file
   http://your_rails_application_uri/security/complete
