<h1>WSO2 Web Services Framework for Ruby Roadmap</h1>
<div id="main" dir="ltr">
	<p>WSO2 WSF/Ruby delivers a comprehensive Web services stack to
	users, providing the luxury of most of the WS-* support in Ruby Web services .
	This Web services framework could be used to provide and
	consume Web services with value added Quality of Services  (QoS)
	support. Currently we support the following specifications:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p>SOAP 1.1</p>
		</li><li><p>SOAP 1.2</p>
		<!--</li><li><p>WSDL 1.1</p>
		</li><li><p>WSDL 2.0</p>-->
		</li><li><p>MTOM</p>
		</li><li><p>WS-Addressing</p>
		</li><li><p>WS-SecurityPolicy</p>
		</li><li><p>WS-Security</p>
		</li><li><p>WS-ReliableMessaging</p>
	</li></ul>
	<p>WSO2 WSF/Ruby distinguishes itself being <b>the first and the only</b> Web Services Framework in Ruby 
	to support this stack of WS specifications.</p>

	<p>The support of WS-Security along with MTOM and WS-Addressing
	ensures that developers seeking to build business-critical
	applications could leverage WSO2 WSF/Ruby for their enterprise
	applications. Given that the WSO2 WSF/Ruby implementation
	interoperates with Microsoft WCF and J2EE implementations such as 
	WSO2 WSAS, further highlights its use in enterprise SOA
	implementations.  
	</p>
	<p>In the coming months we will continue to collaborate with the
	community, enhance the current set of features and improve
	interoperability. Following are some areas that we plan to work on
	in the next few months: 
	</p>
	
	<h3>Add support for WSDL mode (contract first mode)</h3>
	<p>With this, the service and client Ruby scripts can be generated for given WSDL scripts.
	This would have support for WSDL 1.1 and WSDL 2.0. </p>

	<h3>Add support for WSDL generation (code first mode)</h3>
	<p>This would generate WSDL scripts for given service/client scripts.</p>

	<h3>Continue to enhance interoperability with Microsoft WCF and J2EE
	implementations</h3>
	<p>We believe that it is critical to inter-operate, getting WSO2 WSF/Ruby
	clients as well as WSO2 WSF/Ruby based services working with heterogeneous
	implementations. Interoperability testing is done not only at basic
	SOAP and WSDL levels, but also at QoS specification implementations
	such as binary attachments, WS-Security signing and encryption,
	WS-Addressing scenarios and WS-ReliableMessaging scenarios.</p>
	<!--<p>We have participated in the following interoperability events:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p><font size="3">Microsoft WCF Web Services Interoperability
		Plug-Fest – March 2006</font></p>
		</li><li><p><font size="3">Microsoft WCF Web Services Interoperability
		Plug-Fest – November 2006</font></p>
		</li><li><p><font size="3">Microsoft WCF Web Services Interoperability
		Plug-Fest – July 2007</font></p>
	</li></ul>
	<p>WS-Security, MTOM and WS-Addressing were successfully tested and
	issues were fixed at the above inter-op plug-fest events.</p>
	<p><br><br>
	</p>
	<p>We will be participating in the following upcoming
	interoperability events.</p>
	<ul>
		<li value="1"><p><font size="3">Microsoft WCF Web Services
		Interoperability Plug-Fest – November 2007</font></p>
	</li></ul>
	<p>The interoperability events also set the stage to test with other
	J2EE implementations in addition to Microsoft WCF.</p>
	<p>  
	</p>
	<h3>Improve WSDL mode support</h3>
	<p>We have been continuously improving our WSDL support where we are
	able to handle both WSDL 1.1 and WSDL 2.0. We came up with a new
	design for WSDL mode last month and have successfully implemented
	and tested that design for the client side. We would continue to
	implement the new WSDL mode design for the server side as well. This
	new design has enhanced support to handle complex XML schema types
	and WS-Policy elements in WSDL. Once the current phase of
	implementation, which is done using XSLT and PHP, is complete, we
	would implement the same design in C to enhance performance. 
	</p>
	<h3>Improve WSDL generation</h3>
	<p>WSDL generation does not support complex types as of now. However
	we plan on including this by  Q1 of 2008. 
	</p>-->
	<!--<h3>Integrate PECL installation 
	</h3>
	<p>WSO2 WSF/PHP will be made available as a PECL install package, to
	enhance the user experience with installation and setup. We expect
	we would be able to reach much wider audience with PECL install
	support. This feature will be available in the next release expected
	in December 2007. 
	</p>-->
	<h3>Provide easy to use classes for common services</h3>
	<p>WSO2 WSF/Ruby will implement some easy to use Ruby classes to
	consume services such as Yahoo search and Flickr SOAP services. This
	will yield better user experience when consuming those services with
	WSO2 WSF/Ruby.</p>
	<h3>Provide solutions based on WSO2 WSF/Ruby</h3>
	<p>Going beyond the current set of simple services and clients that
	are available as samples with WSO2 WSF/Ruby, we will implement some
	enterprise grade samples for the benefit of users who want to
	explore how to use the WSO2 WSF/Ruby features in an enterprise setup. 
	This is expected to grab most user attraction in the time to come.
	This will let the user experiance the true power of WSO2 WSF/Ruby with some practical scenarios. 
	</p>
	<h3>WS-* support 
	</h3>
	<p>We will be continuously adding to the number of WS-*
	specifications supported, based on the implementations available
	with WSO2 WSF/C.</p>
	<h4>Integrate WS-Eventing support</h4>
	<p>WS-Eventing is supported by WSO2 WSF/C. This will be integrated
	with WSO2 WSF/Ruby.</p>
	<h3>Provide support for different Deployment Models</h3>
	<p>Currently WSO2 WSF/Ruby uses Rails Framework as its deployment model. In the future there 
	will be support for other main stream deployment models as well.</P>
