1. Introduction
===============

The WSO2 WSF Admin consists of a front-end component and a backend component.
The front-end is powered by a customized WSO2 Carbon Console instance while 
the backend is powered by a set of Apache Axis2/C services and modules. This 
document explains how you would install a customized version of WSO2 Carbon
console for administering Apache Axis2/C or WSO2 WSF/C or WSO2 WSF/C++ 
backend instance. It also explains how you would install the admin backend on
Apache Axis2/C or WSO2 WSF/C or WSO2 WSF/C++.

----------------
2. Prerequisites
================

The sole purpose of this application is to administer Apache Axis2/C or 
WSO2 WSF/C or WSO2 WSF/C++ backend. Therefore you need to have one of them 
running on your machine. Also you need to have WSO2 WSF/C installed on 
your machine if you need to build the Admin backend from source.
    
NOTE : You can download these frameworks from the locations mentioned hereunder.
     
      - WSO2 WSF/C     - http://wso2.org/downloads/wsf/cpp
      - WSO2 WSF/C++   - http://wso2.org/downloads/wsf/c
      - Apache Axis2/C - http://ws.apache.org/axis2/c/download.cgi

------------------------------------------
3. Installing the WSO2 Carbon Console (FE)
==========================================

The WSO2 WSF Admin distribution comes with a WSO2 Carbon Console instance 
customized for the backend functionalities. Therefore once you have installed
the WSO2 WSF Admin on your machine, you will also have a WSO2 Carbon Console 
instance that can be used right away. But may also setup a WSO2 Carbon Console 
instance from the scratch as explained below.

3.1 Customizing WSO2 Carbon Console for WSF Admin
-------------------------------------------------

  1. Download an empty Carbon instance from [1]

  2. Install the following set of features on your Carbon instance as explained 
     in [2]
  
     - org.wso2.carbon.module.mgt.ui.feature.group 2.0.2
     - org.wso2.carbon.security.mgt.ui.feature.group 2.0.2
     - org.wso2.carbon.service.mgt.ui.feature.group 2.0.2
     - org.wso2.carbon.system.statistics.ui.feature.group 2.0.2
     - org.wso2.carbon.transport.mgt.ui.feature.group 2.0.2
     - org.wso2.wsas.styles.feature.group 3.1.2
 
  3. Replace the carbon.xml in your %CARBON_HOME%\conf with relevant file
     included in this distribution depending on the product you need to 
     administer

     - For WSO2 WSF/C   - carbon/conf/carbon.c.xml
     - For WSO2 WSF/C++ - carbon/conf/carbon.cpp.xml

  4. Replace org.wso2.wsas.styles-3.1.2 in %CARBON_HOME%\repository\components\
     plugins with relevant jar file included in this distribution depending on 
     the product you need to administer.

     - For WSO2 WSF/C   - carbon/styles/org.wso2.wsas.styles-3.1.2.c.jar
     - For WSO2 WSF/C++ - carbon/styles/org.wso2.wsas.styles-3.1.2.cpp.jar

  5. You now have a WSO2 Carbon Console instance customized for your preferred 
     product

---------------------------------------------
4. Getting the Admin Backend Working on Linux 
=============================================

4.1 Using Source Release
-------------------------
  1. Linux source distribution come as a .zip file named as 
     wso2-wsf-admin-x.y.z.zip
  
  2. unzip the source dist using unzip wso2-wsf-admin-x.y.z.zip
  
  3. Execute the following commands.
     $./configure --with-wsfc=<WSFC INSTALLATION DIR>/include/wsf-2.0.0
     $./make
     $./make install

  4. Launch the interactive installer by running the shell script named 
     setup.sh. You can now select the preferred product, product home directory
     and the preferred installation directory for the WSO2 Carbon Console

  5. You have successfully installed the Admin
 
  6. Now move to the location where you wanted the installer to deploy WSO2
     Carbon Console and start the FE server

	cd <Admin Console installation directory>/bin
	sh wso2server.sh 
  
  7. Go to http://localhost:9763/ using your preferred Web browser to get the 
     WSO2 Carbon Console

  8. Enter in the URI of your already running axis2_http_server in "Server URL" 
     edit box

  10. Now you are ready to try out the Admin. Use username "admin" and password
      "admin" to log in to the WSO2 Carbon Console

-------------------------------------------------------
5. Getting the Admin Backend Working on Windows (Win32)
=======================================================
	
5.1 Using Binary Release
------------------------
  
  1. Unzip the binary distribution into a prefered location
  
  2. Launch the interactive installer by running the setup.bat file. You can 
     now select the preferred product, product home directory
     and the preferred installation directory for the WSO2 Carbon Console

  3. You have successfully installed the Admin
 
  4. Now move to the location where you wanted the installer to deploy WSO2
     Carbon Console and start the FE server

	cd <Admin Console installation directory>/bin
	sh wso2server.sh 
  
  5. Go to http://localhost:9763/ using your preferred Web browser to get the 
     WSO2 Carbon Console

  6. Enter in the URI of your already running axis2_http_server in "Server URL" 
     edit box

  7. Now you are ready to try out the Admin. Use username "admin" and password
     "admin" to log in to the WSO2 Carbon Console 
	
5.2 Using Source Release
------------------------
  
  1. Unzip the source distribution. 
 
  2. Open the configure.in_win32 file using a text editor and specify your 
     configuaration settings.
 
  3. Now run the build.bat file in the same directory as follows
	
     build.bat mkdist
 
  4. This would build WSO2 WSF Admin and copy the binary files in to a 
     directory named wso2-wsf-admin-bin-m1-win32 inside the build directory.
 
  5. Launch the interactive installer by running the setup.bat file. You can 
     now select the preferred product, product home directory
     and the preferred installation directory for the WSO2 Carbon Console

  6. You have successfully installed the Admin
 
  7. Now move to the location where you wanted the installer to deploy WSO2
     Carbon Console and start the FE server

	cd <Admin Console installation directory>/bin
	sh wso2server.sh 
  
  8. Go to http://localhost:9763/ using your preferred Web browser to get the 
     WSO2 Carbon Console

  9. Enter in the URI of your already running axis2_http_server in "Server URL" 
     edit box

  10. Now you are ready to try out the Admin. Use username "admin" and password
      "admin" to log in to the WSO2 Carbon Console
